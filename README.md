# XamarinForms.CancelableModal

Xamarin.Forms doesn't support closing modal page out of the box. We have to implement this feature manually. 

This sample project presents how to implement a close button on a modal page in Xamarin.Forms. The close button is implemented according to the guidelines provided by Apple and Google.
